# Update validation

## Overview
Update Validation, a feature within the [Cloud Update](cloud-update.md) service in the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com), enables administrators to validate new updates for the [Monthly Enterprise Channel](../updates/overview-update-channels.md#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview) before organization-wide deployment. This feature automatically collects and consolidates health indicators such as app and add-in performance and reliability data and brings attention to any identified issues. Its automated nature reduces the need for manual administrative work and simplifies the update deployment process.

> [!NOTE]
> Update validation for add-ins is currently in private preview. It will become broadly available in Q1 2024.

## Benefits
Many large organizations choose to roll out new updates to only some devices at first. This helps them find and fix potential problems early on and reduce the chance of having serious issues affect a lot of devices. But this also means more work for the admins. They often have to manually gather early feedback from sources like the help desk team or specific testers. And the feedback may not be clear or detailed enough to identify the real issues without more investigation and troubleshooting. This adds to the admin's workload and slows down the deployment of the update.

Update validation helps administrators to automatically gather health signals, check them for devices on the first deployment wave, and determine if it's safe to proceed with the update deployment. Administrators can see a single interface that walks them through the process. Problems across apps and add-ins are automatically detected, evaluated, and highlighted. If there are issues, administrators can easily identify the affected devices, apps, and add-ins. Also, administrators can stop the rollout or restore updated devices to the previous update, all from the same administrative interface.

Update validation removes any irrelevant or inaccurate information from the health data by using statistical tests and thresholds. The admins get assessments based on reliable insights that show the actual impacts on the user's workflow.

## How it works

Update validation is automatically enabled once you have set up a custom rollout wave for the Monthly Enterprise Channel in Cloud Update. Once Cloud Update deploys a new update to device, the following actions are performed automatically:

- **Calculation of pre-update health:**  Using the Diagnostic Data received from devices on the first deployment wave from the seven days prior to the update release, it calculates performance and reliability baselines for each individual device, individual app and individual add-in.
- **Calculation of post-update health:** Once a device has installed the latest update, the same baselines are calculated till a statistical confidence of 95% is reached.
- **Filtering and comparison**: It compares the pre- and post-update metrics and calculates the actual change. Minor degradations below a certain threshold are filtered out.
- **Scoring**: Negative changes (degradations) are individually scored.
- **Calculating and showing assessment**: Once scores from at least ten devices are available, those get summarized and an assessment is shown to the admin. If the assessment is yellow or red, the admin can review which devices, apps, add-ins and metrics were impacted:
    - **Green:** No degradations or only very minor degradations were detected. The admin is encouraged to proceed with the deployment of the update.
    - **Yellow:** Minor degradation was detected, and the admin is advised to monitor the deployment closely.
    - **Red:** At least one major degradation was detected, and the admin is offered the option to pause the deployment or initiate a rollback.

The process automatically repeats with every new release of an update for the Monthly Enterprise Channel. More details on thresholds, prerequisites and the scoring are available below.

## How to enable update validation

To use update validation, the following requirements must be met:
- Devices must be managed via cloud update.
- Diagnostic data must be turned on for your devices.
- Devices must be on Monthly Enterprise Channel.
- You must configure and implement rollout waves.
- A period of seven days must be set between wave one and wave two rollouts.

Ensure that wave one devices offer a diverse representation of your organizationâ€™s departments and usage scenarios, including various add-ins. This diverse representation promotes early issue detection and timely resolution, further minimizing potential risks.


## How it works

If cloud updates is configured with at least two custom rollout waves, update validation is enabled by default. When a new update for the Monthly Enterprise Channel is released and begins to deploy to devices on wave 1, update validation automatically performs the following actions for each device:

- It calculates the pre-update health baseline. It uses the Diagnostic Data received within the seven days before the update to measure the start performance and reliability of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and each individual add-in.
- It calculates the post-update health metrics. After a device applies the update, it continuously calculates the same health metrics.
- Once a statistical confidence of 95% is reached, it compares the pre- and post-update metrics and calculates the actual change. Minor degradations below a certain threshold are filtered out.
- It applies a scoring system to evaluate the remaining degradations.

After calculating scores for at least 10 devices, an assessment is run, and the results are displayed to the admin. The results are color-coded and continuously updated with more data being received:

- **Green:** No degradations or only very minor degradations were detected. The admin is encouraged to proceed with the deployment of the update.
- **Yellow:** Minor degradation was detected, and the admin is advised to monitor the deployment closely.
- **Red:** At least one major degradation was detected, and the admin is offered the option to pause the deployment or initiate an update rollback.

For a status of yellow or red, the admin can view the list of devices and see which device, add-in/app, and health metric caused the status change.

## How thresholds and scoring works

As explained, each device, app and add-in has several health metrics. A device without add-ins would have 20 metrics: app start performance and app reliability for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. These metrics are divided into 10 pre-update and 10 post-update ones. Each add-in adds four more metrics. The metrics are compared and filtered after reaching a statistical confidence of 95%, using the following thresholds:

- For apps, start performance must take more than 5 seconds to start and at least 1 second longer than before.
- For apps, reliability must be less than 99% and at least 1 percentage point lower than before.
- For add-ins, start performance is at least 1 second slower than before.
- For add-ins, reliability must be less than 99% and at least 1 percentage point lower than before.

The thresholds help to ignore degradations that are statistically significant, but not disruptive to users. For instance, suppose Outlook's app start performance worsens from two seconds to three seconds. This is a 50% degradation, but it doesn't affect the user much. Outlook still starts up quickly. Similarly, if the reliability drops from 99.9% to 99.8%, the crash rate technically doubles from 0.1% to 0.2%. But only two out of a thousand app sessions are affected. This change might not disrupt the user's daily routine.

The following criteria are used to score the metrics that pass the threshold filter:
- A degradation in the start performance of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, or OneNote: 0.5 points
- A degradation in the start performance of an add-in: 0.25 points
- A degradation in the reliability of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, or OneNote: 1 point
- A degradation in the reliability of an add-in: 0.5 points

The scores for all devices are added up. A score higher than 0.5 means a yellow status, and a score higher than 1 means a red status. For example:
- On one device, Word starts slower than before and exceeds the threshold. This gives 0.5 points and a yellow status.
- On two devices, an add-in crashes more frequently than before and exceeds the threshold. This gives 0.5 points twice, or 1 point total, and a red status.




## How to disable update validation

In case you want to disable update validation, your options are:
- Navigate to **Cloud Update > Monthly Enterprise channel > Settings > Rollout waves** and select the **Opt out of update validation** option.
- If you disabled waves by setting the option **Use rollout waves** to *No, not needed*, update validation is automatically disabled.
