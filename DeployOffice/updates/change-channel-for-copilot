# Change update channel of Microsoft 365 Apps to enable Copilot usage

## Overview

To use Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 Apps must run on [Current](verview-update-channels.md#current-channel-overview) or [Monthly Enterprise Channel](overview-update-channels.md#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview). This article provides configuration guidance and best practices on how to switch Microsoft 365 Apps to such a channel.

Based on your preferred managament solution, choose from the options below for instructions. Microsoft recommend to leverage [Cloud Update](../admincenter/cloud-update.md), as it provides the most streamlined and easiest experience.

- Cloud Update(#cloud-updates)
- Microsoft Intune
- Microsoft Configuration Manager
- Microsoft AutoPatch
- Group Policies
- Servicing Profiles (deprecated)

> [!NOTE]
> The configurations covered in this document are based on working best practices. It is highly recommended that you review, test, and validate according to the needs of your environment.
 
## Pre-Checks
Our general recommendation for Microsoft 365 Apps is to direct devices to the Office CDN. As Current Channel is receiving updates frequently, not on a set schedule, and multiple times a month, using the Office CDN is even more advised.
1.	Verify that your network allows devices to access the Microsoft CDN directly or through a proxy.
2.	Consider enabling [Delivery Optimization for Microsoft 365 Apps](../delivery-optimization.md) to help reduce the traffic on your internet links.

## Cloud Update
This section covers the recommended approach for moving devices to Current Channel. It walks you through the necessary steps on how enable automatic updates and initiate the channel change.

### Video-based instructions
If you prefer watching short videos over reading text, view below videos:

2. [Overview of Current Channel Profile](https://youtu.be/wwguIOw788I)
3. [How to trigger an update channel change](https://youtu.be/tFmktdQsKgY)

We recommend using Entra ID groups with user objects for initiating the channel change. It makes targeting the right subset of devices easier, especially when using the same Entra ID group for assigning Copilot licenses. The service automatically translates user objects into the matching device objects, based on activation data.

### Create a security group
The Channel Change feature can target individual devices or whole Entra ID groups. Groups can contain user or device objects, or a combination of both.

1.	Create a new security group in Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory) for the intended Copilot users or devices. For guidance on this step, refer to [QuickStart: Create a group with members](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/groups-view-azure-portal).
2.	Add the objects to this security group that need to be moved to Current Channel and have update management applied to. 

### Enable Current Channel profile
In order to keep devices updated and secure after moving to Current Channel, we recommend enabling the Current Channel profile in Cloud Update. Note that the Current Channel profile applies to all devices on Current Channel. If you need to exclude devices from being serviced, use the **Exclude devices** feature under **Cloud Updates** > **Overview** > **Tenant Settings**.

1. Log into the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com), you should land on the **Home** page automatically.
2. On the **Recommendation based on your tenant** card, select **Finish enabling cloud**.
3. Wait a moment and refresh the page.
4. Verify that the **Current** entry is listed under the **Cloud Update** navigation.
5. Select **Current**, review the presented data.
6. Optionally, you can adjust the **deadline setting** on the **Tenant settings** tab.

### Initiate channel change
Next step is to trigger the actual update channel change.
1. While staying in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center, navigate to **Inventory**.
2. Select **Show all devices** and select the **Switch device update channel** button on the top.
3. Select **Current Channel** and enter which devices should be moved.
    - You can enter device names or Entra ID groups, or a mix of both.
    - For Entry ID groups, such groups can be nested up to three levels down and contain a mix of device and user objects.
4. Select **Move devices** to initiate the channel change.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 24 hours for the channel change to be completed by the device, assuming devices are online and can connect to the service.

> [!NOTE]
> A channel change is a point-in-time activity. If you are using Entra ID groups and add devices or users to the group after initiating a channel change, those devices will not be moved automatically. You will have to initiate the channel change for this group again. There is no need to remove already switched devices fom the group.

## Validation
You can validate the implementation by monitoring the following aspects:
- Within 24 hours, you should see the devices being listed in the **Current** profile.
- Within 24 hours, you should see the **Update Channel** switching to Current Channel in inventory.
- On the device, the following registry key should change to "**1**", as profile's control is established on the device:
   - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\cloud\office\16.0\Common\officeupdate > IgnoreGPO
- It switches from any channel to the latest build released into the Current Channel.
- Other apps like Visio, Project or Access Runtime are migrated to Current Channel as well and are updated in the same pass.
