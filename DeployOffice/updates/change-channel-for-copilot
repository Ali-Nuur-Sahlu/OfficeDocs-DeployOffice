# Change update channel of Microsoft 365 Apps to enable Copilot

## Overview

To use Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 Apps must run on [Current](verview-update-channels.md#current-channel-overview) or [Monthly Enterprise Channel](overview-update-channels.md#monthly-enterprise-channel-overview). This article provides configuration guidance and best practices on how to switch Microsoft 365 Apps to such a channel.

> [!NOTE]
> Assigning the Copilot licenses to users is a required step which is not covered in this documentation

Based on your preferred managament solution, choose from the options below for instructions. Microsoft recommend to leverage [Cloud Update](../admincenter/cloud-update.md), as it provides the most streamlined and easiest experience.

- [Cloud Update](#cloud-update)
- Microsoft Intune
- Microsoft Configuration Manager
- Microsoft AutoPatch
- Group Policies
- Servicing Profiles (deprecated)

> [!NOTE]
> The configurations covered in this document are based on working best practices. It is highly recommended that you review, test, and validate according to the needs of your environment.
 
## Pre-Checks
Our general recommendation for Microsoft 365 Apps is to direct devices to the Office CDN. As Current Channel is receiving updates frequently, not on a set schedule, and multiple times a month, using the Office CDN is even more advised.
1.	Verify that your network allows devices to access the Microsoft CDN directly or through a proxy.
2.	Consider enabling [Delivery Optimization for Microsoft 365 Apps](../delivery-optimization.md) to help reduce the traffic on your internet links.

## Cloud Update
This section covers the recommended approach for changing the update channel using Cloud Updates. It walks you through the  steps of enabling Cloud Update and initiating the channel change.

We recommend using Entra ID groups with user objects for initiating the channel change. It makes targeting the right subset of devices easier, especially when using the same Entra ID group for assigning Copilot licenses. The service automatically translates user objects into the matching device objects, based on activation data.

### Prepare an Entra ID security group
The Channel Change feature can target individual devices or whole Entra ID groups. Groups can contain user or device objects, or a combination of both.

1.	Create a new security group in Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory) for the intended Copilot users or devices. For guidance on this step, refer to [QuickStart: Create a group with members](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/groups-view-azure-portal).
2.	Add the user or device objects to the security group. If you are using device object, ensure that the devices are (hybrid) Entra ID-joined, otherwise those can't be targeted. There is no such requirement when using user objects.

### Enable Cloud Update
With the enablement of Cloud Updates, the service will automatically manage all Microsoft 365 Apps installations on Monthly Enterprise Channel. We recommend to also enable the profile for Current Channel to keep those devices updated as well.

If you need to exclude devices from being serviced, use the **Exclude devices** feature under **Cloud Updates** > **Overview** > **Tenant Settings**.

If you prefer watching short videos over reading text, review these links:

1. [Enable the Current Channel Profile](https://youtu.be/lRegLZUjkUY)
1. [Overview of Current Channel Profile](https://youtu.be/wwguIOw788I)

Otherwise follow these instructions:

1. Log into the [Microsoft 365 Apps admin center](https://config.office.com), you should land on the **Home** page automatically.
1. On the **Recommendation based on your tenant** card, select **Enable cloud**.
1. Wait a moment and refresh the page.
1. Verify that the **Monthly Enterprise** entry is listed under the **Cloud Update** navigation.
1. Navigate back to the **Home** page and click on **Finish enabling cloud** to activate the Current Channel profile as well.
1. Wait a moment and refresh the page.
1. Verify that the **Current** entry is listed under the **Cloud Update** navigation.

### Initiate a channel change
Next step is to trigger the actual update channel change.

If you prefer watching a short video over reading text, review this link:

- [How to trigger an update channel change](https://youtu.be/tFmktdQsKgY)

Otherwise follow these instructions:

1. While staying in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center, navigate to **Inventory**.
1. Select **Show all devices** and select the **Switch device update channel** button on the top.
1. Select which devices should be moved and the targeted update channel.
    - You can enter device names or Entra ID groups, or a mix of both.
    - For Entry ID groups, such groups can be nested up to three levels down and contain a mix of device and user objects.
1. Select **Move devices** to initiate the channel change.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to 24 hours for the channel change to be completed by the device, assuming devices are online and can connect to the service.

> [!NOTE]
> A channel change is a point-in-time activity. If you are using Entra ID groups and add devices or users to the group after initiating a channel change, those devices will not be moved automatically. You will have to initiate the channel change again. There is no need to remove already switched devices from the group.

### Validation
You can validate the implementation by monitoring the following aspects:
- Within 24 hours, you should see the devices being listed in the **Monthly Enterprise** or **Current** profile.
- Within 24 hours, you should see the **Update Channel** changing to the targeted one in inventory.
- On the device, the following registry key should change to "**1**", as profile's control is established on the device:
   - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\cloud\office\16.0\Common\officeupdate > IgnoreGPO
- Other apps like Visio, Project or Access Runtime are migrated to Current Channel as well and are updated in the same pass.

## Microsoft Intune

In this section, we cover the recommended policy settings for managing the update channel and update servicing options for Microsoft 365 Apps using Microsoft Intune.

If you want to move some devices to Current Channel and others to Monthly Enterprise Channel, you need to repeat the steps for each update channel.

### Create an Entra ID security group
1.	Create a new security group in Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory) for targeted devices. For guidance on this step, refer to [QuickStart: Create a group with members](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/groups-view-azure-portal).
1.	Add the computer objects to this security group that need to be moved and have update management applied to. 

### Create a configuration profile
Create a new configuration profile in Microsoft Intune. Refer to the following steps:
1.	Sign in to [https://endpoint.microsoft.com/](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) with an account that has the Intune Administrator role.
1.	From the left navigation, select **Devices**.
1.	Under **Policy**, select **Configuration profiles**.
1.	From the **Devices | Configuration profile**s page, select **+ Create profile**.
1.	From the **Create a profile** flyout, select the following and click **Create**:
    - Platform: Windows 10 and later
    - Profile type: Settings catalog
1.	From the **Create profile** page, on the **Basics** tab, provide a name for this profile and select **Next**. For example: **Profile – Microsoft 365 Apps on CC**.
1.	From the **Configuration settings** tab, select **+Add settings**.
1.	From the **Settings picker** flyout, select **Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine) > Updates**.
1.	On the lower-third of the flyout, mark the checkboxes for the following settings and apply the corresponding configuration. 

|**Setting Name**  |**Configuration**  |
|:---|:---|
|Enable Automatic Updates|Enabled|
|Hide option to enable or disable updates|Enabled|
|Hide update notifications|Disabled|
|Office 365 Client Management|Disabled|
|Update Channel|Enabled → Current Channel or Monthly Enterprise Channel|
|Update Deadline|Enabled → 1|
|Update Path|Enabled → For Current Channel enter `http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/492350f6-3a01-4f97-b9c0-c7c6ddf67d60` For Monthly Enterprise enter `	http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/55336b82-a18d-4dd6-b5f6-9e5095c314a6`|
|Target Version|Disabled|

1.	select **Next**.
1.	From the **Scope tags** tab, select **Next**.
1.	From the **Assignments** tab, add your Current Channel security group and select **Next**. 
1.	On the **Review + create** tab, select **Create**.

### Monitor assignment
Monitor the progress of your configuration profile assignment using the following steps:
1.	From the left navigation, select **Devices**.
1.	Under **Policy**, select **Configuration profiles**.
1.	Locate the policy you want to monitor and select it. Review the status at the top of the profile page.

The Microsoft 365 Apps perform the full update channel switch within the next 24 hours. Devices switch from any channel to the latest build released. Other apps like Visio, Project or Access Runtime are migrated to Current Channel as well and are updated in the same pass.
